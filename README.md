 Student Management System

 Overview
The  Student Management System  is a C++ application designed to manage student records efficiently. It uses object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, while incorporating file handling for persistent storage.

Features
1. Add Undergraduate Student: Input and store details such as ID, name, age, and major.
2. Add Graduate Student: Input and store details such as ID, name, age, and thesis title.
3. Display All Students: View all student records categorized by type.
4. Save Students to File: Persist student records to a file (`students.txt`).
5. Read Students from File: Retrieve and display student records from the file.
6. Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs and file operation errors gracefully.

Requirements
Software Requirements
- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC)
Installation
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or a terminal.
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
4. Run the compiled program:
 Usage

Example Workflow
1. Select "Add Undergraduate Student".
2. Input details (e.g., ID: 101, Name: "John Doe", Age: 20, Major: "Computer Science").
3. Repeat to add a graduate student.
4. Display all students to confirm entries.
5. Save records to a file.
6. Exit the program.
